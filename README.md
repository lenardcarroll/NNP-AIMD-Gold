# NNP-AIMD-Gold

Using a constant number of particles, volume and temperature ensemble alongside the equipartitition theorem, we can calculate the temperature of the system using:

$$\text{T}_\text{actual}  = \frac{3}{2NK_B}\sum_{i=1}^N \text{KE}_i$$

where $N$ is the number of particles in the system, $K_B$ is the Boltzmann constant and $\text{KE}_{i}$ is the kinetic energy of the particle such that:

$$\text{KE}_i = \frac{1}{2}m_iv_i^2$$


$\sum_{i=1}^N \text{KE}_i$

$$\left( \sum_{k=1}^n a_k b_k \right)^2$$

$\text{Temperture}_\text{Target} = N$
